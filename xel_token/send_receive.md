# How to receive/send XEL tokens?

You can use the [Web Wallet](https://docs.elastic.pw/tutorials/lite_wallet/web_wallet) or [setup your own Locally](https://docs.elastic.pw/tutorials/lite_wallet). You start by creating an account that gives you your own Public address and your personal and private passphrase that you want to keep safe.
