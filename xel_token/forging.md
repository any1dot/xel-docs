# How can XEL tokens be earned?

You earn XEL tokens by running a full Node on your Computer or Server. If you own 1000 XEL tokens or more you can start Forging. Forging is nothing more than verifying Blocks for their validity also know as POS \(Proof of Stake\). In the process you get rewarded with transaction fees on your validated Block.

You can also earn tokens by using your computer to solve complex mathematical tasks also known as mining. You may receive tokens while attempting to solve the task as well as higher reward Bounties if you discover a solution. This process is also called POW \(Proof of Work\).
