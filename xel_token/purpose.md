# What purpose do XEL tokens serve?

Besides its own dedicated blockchain, the Elastic platform uses the native XEL token. XEL serves as a medium of exchange to reward miners with proportional bounties for providing computing power.

XEL tokens fuel the whole Elastic software engine. Without it you canâ€™t buy Computational resources within the platform or get compensated for offering your CPU, GPU mining resources.
