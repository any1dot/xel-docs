# ELASTIC PL \(ePL\)

With [ePL \(Elastic Programming Language\)](https://docs.elastic.pw/a/epl) you are able to program and customize any work task, for solving algorithmic difficulties.

In order to get your work task solved, you need to upload the programed file into the [XELINE Wallet](https://docs.elastic.pw/tutorials/xeline_wallet), with parameters preset like duration of the task and Bounties \(done in with XEL token\). In return, users/miners of the Elastic platform can compete to solve your problem \(complex mathematical calculations\) and earn tokens in exchange for their CPU, GPU Computational resources.
