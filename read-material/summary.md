# SUMMARY

I will not go deep into technical jibber jabber here and instead save it for the later sections. Yet, I feel it is important to quickly summarize what we have achieved in the last 2 years. After two years of coding - almost daily - and with the help of many very talented people, we have finally achieved a huge milestone. A milestone that - to my knowledge - nobody has ever achieved before as of now. We as a community have finally managed to launch a first working version of a truly decentralized super-computer - for now, in a test net to be honest - that allows people to submit arbitrary, self-coded jobs to the blockchain and have their tasks solved by so-called "miners" who are incentivized by tit-for-tat payments as they contribute their computational resources towards that task.

At this point I would like to thank everyone who has contributed his time, his resources and his dedication towards this project - without you guys we would not be at the point where we stand right now. I know it has been a hard walk, since many people have treaten us like servants, slaves or, even worse, as pure garbage while all we ever wanted to do is having fun with some fellow travellers on this wonderful journey called XEL, just coding that idea of a super-computer which, let's face it, started very immature in the beginning and gradually improved until it finally became what it is today. Still, there is always room for improvement and there are always new things to add - technology has always been a work in progress and always will be. So I hope that this update attracts more devs who find this project interesting, who genuinely \(if you want money, you are the wrong person\) want to learn more about XEL's design and who can bring some fresh air into it.

Even though I have everything I need, if you want to help me enjoy life a bit more \(e.g., doing that pilot licence, that I have been dreaming of for the last 10 years\), feel free \(but only if it comes from your heart\) to give me a little gift - but make damn sure you do not expect anything in return. No strings \(and nothing else crypto related\) attached, that is. Will be spent of joyful things and on tax authorities only. And remember, this is not a start-up company or anything, this is a community project comprised of many autonomous agents collaborating together, if you want to support the other wonderful people who helped getting where we are not, please reach out to them.

By the way, some wonderful people, i guess they are as much of a XEL fanboy as I am, are right now putting together a nice website with lots of more information than you will find here. So be patient and lurk around :\)

Enough of this sentimental talk, let's get started.
