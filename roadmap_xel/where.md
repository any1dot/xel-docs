# Where can Elastic XEL roadmap be found?

Elastic is an Open Source project, as such it does not rely on any individual, group or entity. People from around the world share their time and knowledge to contribute in various areas, together they are building Elastic.

At the moment you wonâ€™t find any roadmap for Elastic as there is no organization that could take responsibility for it.

Anything that is being developed happens at free will by volunteers, however current developers are eager to release working full Client that meets expectations Elastic promises; first distributed and decentralized Super-Computer on top of the blockchain.

Please note that this can change at any given time, if and when Elastic community decides that setting up foundation type of entity is beneficial for Elastic project; roadmap can be given.
