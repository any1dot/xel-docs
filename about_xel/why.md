# Why is Elastic XEL different?

Invention of Bitcoin and blockchain opened whole new prospect of innovation in this space, using this technology Elastic developers have succeeded making first working Alpha of distributed and decentralized SuperComputer. First ElasticPL use case has been [documented](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oo4bn550YEk) in late 2016.

Mining Bitcoins is not a practical use case \(the cost of mining Bitcoins would be far greater than the amount youâ€™d gain\), but it is a great way to demonstrate the potential of Elastic. With Elastic you can design your own tasks/requirements using the Elastic programming language \(Elastic PL\). The Elastic programming language allows Elastic job authors to express complex algorithms to be solved for bounties, paid for with XEL, the Elastic crypto currency. The language is loosely based on the C programming language incorporating many of the basic operators and functions.\\n\\nhttps://www.elastic.pw/blog/2017-06-11-bitcoin-mining-with-decentralized-supercomputer/\",\"icon\":{\"type\":\"icon\",\"url\":\"https://www.youtube.com/yts/img/favicon\_144-vfliLAfaB.png\",\"width\":144,\"height\":144,\"aspectRatio\":1},\"thumbnail\":{\"type\":\"thumbnail\",\"url\":\"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/oo4bn550YEk/maxresdefault.jpg\",\"width\":1280,\"height\":720,\"aspectRatio\":0.5625},\"embed\":{\"type\":\"player\",\"url\":\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/oo4bn550YEk?rel=0&showinfo=0\",\"html\":\"<div style=\\\"left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.2493%;\\\"><iframe src=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/oo4bn550YEk?rel=0&amp;showinfo=0\\\" style=\\\"border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;\\\" allowfullscreen scrolling=\\\"no\\\"></iframe></div>\",\"aspectRatio\":1.7778},\"caption\":\"elastic xel demo\"}" %}

It shows how you can mine Bitcoin Block using Elastic platform. Mining Bitcoins is not a practical use case, but it is a great way to demonstrate the potential of Elastic.
