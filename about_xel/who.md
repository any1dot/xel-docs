# What is the Elastic XEL project?

Elastic \(XEL\) is an Open Source project aimed to create a decentralized Super-Computer by utilizing cryptography and blockchain technology. It creates a complex platform that can execute vast array of tasks in need of Computational resources to solve its algorithmic difficulties; all is done in P2P distributed way inside of Elastic platform.

Elastic is trustless system, anyone in need of computing power can do that in Elastic anonymous without the need to trust platform itself other than it will execute task as programed.

Elastic Source code is public and anyone can freely contribute and review it. At current stage several anonymous developers are working to bring the Elastic platform into production phase, ready to be tested and deployed into the network.
