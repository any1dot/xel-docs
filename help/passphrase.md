# I lost my passphrase, help?

In this event there is nothing that developers or community can do, your passphrase is to be stored by you for safekeeping.

{% hint style="danger" %}
Without your passphrase you will lose access to your XEL tokens, so make sure you store your passphrase somewhere safe.
{% endhint %}
